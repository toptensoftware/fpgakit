# FpgaKit

## Build Prerequisites

To build this project you'll need a Linux machine with the following 
tools installed:

* [Xilinx ISE Design Suite 14.7](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/ise-design-suite.html) (the free WebPack license will do)
* [Node 10.x](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v8.x might work too)
* [Xilt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xilt) (front-end driver for Xilinx command line tool chain).
* Make (ie: sudo apt-get install build-essential)
* [GHDL](http://ghdl.free.fr) (optional, required to run simulations)
* [GTKWave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net) (options, required to view simulations)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux) (optional)

To install any or all of the above you might find my [xilsetup](https://bitbucket.org/toptensoftware/xilsetup/) script handy.


## Build Instructions (Mimas V2)

To build the FPGA hardware project:

```
$ cd ./boards/mimasv2/<projectname>
$ make
```

The final .bin file will be in the `/build` directory of the project

I recommend using [this updated firmware](https://github.com/toptensoftware/MimasV2-Loader) for the Mimas V2 which will then let you upload to the board like so:

```
$ make upload
```

Notes:

1. if you're running Linux in a virtual machine, you'll have to make sure the USB port the
board is plugged into is forwarded by the VM host. In VirtualBox, check the Devices -> USB menu.
2. for the Mimas V2 board you need to upload the `.bin` file - not the `.bit` file.
3. the `./boards/mimasv2` directory also contains several other experiments and 
test projects that you can try if you're interested.


## Running Simulation Test Benches

Simulation test benches for various components are available in the `./sims` sub-directory.

These simulations have only been tested using the LLVM build of GHDL - they may or may not
work in the other builds.

To run and view the simulation signal traces,  run `make view` in the project directory.

```
$ cd ./sims/01-sim-basics
$ make view
```

## Project Structre

The directory structure of this project is as follows:


* `./boards` - anything that's specific to a particular FPGA board.
* `./resources` - miscellaneous resources like original ROM images etc...
* `./shared` - shared VHDL components that aren't specific to a TRS-80
* `./sims` - all simulation test benches
* `./tools` - tools and scripts.

The `./boards` and `./sims` directory both contain numbered sub-projects.  The idea here is to keep all experiments and test benches and the numbers help keep them in sequence.

Within each project directory is a VS Code workpace file and tasks.json file.  To work with these:

1. Change to the directory of the project
2. Run `code workspace.code-workspace`
3. Use the VS Code build command to build the project
4. For FPGA projects, use the Terminal menu -> Run Task -> "Upload" task program the board
5. For simulation projects, use the Terminal menu -> Run Task -> "View" task to run the simulation and launch GTKWave.

Note: if you launch GTKWave from VS Code you'll need to close it before being able to run additional tasks in VS Code.  I've not been able to find a solution for this.  Remember to Ctrl+S before closing GTKWave to keep your displayed signals and positions.
